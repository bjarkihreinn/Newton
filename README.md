# Newton
Newton is a game engine in development. It's intended for 2D physics-based games.


18.2.2022

The spot where the engine is now in development is in it's earlier phases and has just started development.
I am very excited to see how far this game engine goes.

The first game demo is expected to release in a couple of weeks/months. The demo will be a simple collision based game.
examples of a collision based game that will be created as a demo will be Astroids and a circle vs circle collision game.
